Python codes for calculating common drought metrics from gridded data

SPI-based metrics are calculated as per:
Ukkola et al., Evaluating CMIP5 model agreement for multiple drought metrics,
Journal of Hydrometeorology, 2018
https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0099.1

Percentile-based metrics use a set percentile for determining droughts. Percentile codes updates to codes used in:
Ukkola et al., Robust future changes in meteorological drought in CMIP6 projections despite uncertainty in precipitation, Geophysical Research Letters, 46, e2020GL087820. 
https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087820
